        <h1>Homework 8: </h1>
        
        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>This project uses vector geoprocessing analysis to answer the following real-world question: Is there overlap between recognized Native American reservations and crude oil pipelines?</p>
        
        <!-- Pre-work Discussion -->
        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Prior to beginning geoprocessing, I used a number of techniques from previous units to reduce the data to work at the scale of Mecklenburg County. I found the location of the Huntersville spill from the NCEQ website and created a shapefile for the location in EPSG 2264. Using queries, I reduced the EIA Petroleum Product Pipelines data to a layer featuring only the Colonial Pipeline. The Colonial Pipeline spans many states, so I used an intersection with a NC boundary shapefile to retain only the NC segment of the pipeline. Later on I clipped the NC Colonial Pipeline to just the segment within Mecklenburg County. I downloaded public and private well locations in Mecklenburg County. I reprojected all files to the EPSG 2264 projection. Lastly, I created a population density choropleth at the census block scale using 2020 ACS estimates.</p><br>

        <!-- Discussion of methods and presentation of results -->
        <h2>Methods and Results</h2>
        <p>According to the NC Environmental Quality website, in response to the emergency, Colonial Pipeline established a 2,000 feet area for environmental sampling. I recreated the 2,000ft buffer around the accident site. I then performed an intersection between the buffer and the wells (only private wells were in the area). The output of the intersection was 35 private well sites. I counted the total using the vector analysis tool. I then generated a unique value list using the well id, if I was in the field I would use the well ids to find the well locations for sampling.</p><br>
