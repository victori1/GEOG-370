    <h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
    <h2>Ratio of Births to Married Women to Total Births by County in Indiana</h2>
    <h3>This ratio was calculated by dividing the number of births to married women by the number of total births in each county in the state of Indiana. The reason for the ratio is to show the distribution of births within marriage across the state in relation to total biorths that include births to widowed, divorced, separated, and never married women.</h3>
